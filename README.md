# DETR (DEtection TRansformer) Model
## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of the DETR (DEtection TRansformer) model, a state-of-the-art object detection framework that leverages transformers for end-to-end object detection. DETR eliminates the need for hand-crafted components like anchor generation and non-maximum suppression, simplifying the detection pipeline while achieving competitive performance.

This implementation is based on the original DETR paper by Carion et al. and is designed to be easy to use, modify, and extend for your own projects.

## Features 
End-to-End Object Detection: Directly predicts object bounding boxes and class labels without intermediate steps.

Transformer-Based Architecture: Utilizes a transformer encoder-decoder architecture for global reasoning.

Pre-Trained Models: Includes pre-trained weights for COCO and other datasets.

Custom Dataset Support: Easily train on your own datasets with minimal modifications.

Efficient Training and Inference: Optimized for both training and inference on GPUs.
